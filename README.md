# EEDH: Accurate RRKM Rate Constant Calculator
This is a Python-based tool for calculating **RRKM (Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus) unimolecular rate constants** with optional tunneling corrections. 
It is only used to calculate the microscopic rate constant k(E) of a single path, and the current calculation speed is relatively slow.
example.txt is the input file.
