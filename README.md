# EEDH: Microscopic Rate Constant Calculator
This is a Python-based tool for calculating **RRKM (Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus) unimolecular rate constants** with optional tunneling corrections. Density of states counting is achieved by counting the full quantum states of reactants and transition state molecules one by one in terms of vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom It is only used to calculate the microscopic rate constant k(E) of a single path, and the current calculation speed is relatively slow.
example.txt is the input file.
